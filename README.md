MIMO System Simulation

Project1:
  Simulated MIMO system with ZF, LMMSE receiver and compared the results of BER vs SNR in MATLAB
  
  Observation: A 2x2 MIMO system is mplemented and it is observed that the LMMSE receiver performs better than the ZF receiver at low SNR. But as SNR goes on increasing the difference between the two tends to zero.

Project2:
  A 4X4 MIMO systemâ€™s capacity is found by allocating equal power, optimal power using water filling
  algorithm and plotted the capacity for optimal power allocation, equal power vs SNR using Python
  
  Observation: A 4x4 MIMO system is implemented and it is observed that the optimal power allocation obtained from the Water Filling Algorithm leads to a higher capacity than equal power allocation at all SNR levels.

Project3:
  Analysed the capacity vs SNR curves of SIMO, SISO, AWGN channels in MATLAB
  
  Observation: The channel capacity of AWGN > capacity of SIMO > capacity of SISO and the capacity increases with increase in SNR in all the cases. So, as number of antennas increases the capacity increases and the AWGN channel has highest SNR

project4:
  Designed a Spatial Modulation and a SSK system and plotted their BER performance using Python
  
  Observation: In SSK, we don't use a modulation scheme at the transmitter as is the case in Spatial modulation but rather use a fixed symbol over the antennas. We observe the classic waterfall diagram for BER vs SNR in spatial modulation and in SSK.
