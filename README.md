**Capacity comparison of AWGN, SIMO, SISO, MIMO:**
-------------------------------------------------


  A 4X4 MIMO systemâ€™s capacity is found by allocating equal power, optimal power using water filling
  algorithm and plotted the capacity for optimal power allocation, equal power vs SNR using Python  
  Observation: A 4x4 MIMO system is implemented and it is observed that the optimal power allocation obtained from the Water Filling Algorithm leads to a higher capacity than equal power allocation at all SNR levels.

  Analysed the capacity vs SNR curves of SIMO, SISO, AWGN channels in MATLAB  
  Observation: The channel capacity of AWGN > capacity of SIMO > capacity of SISO and the capacity increases with increase in SNR in all the cases. So, as number of antennas increases the capacity increases and the AWGN channel has highest SNR
