The conference paper has been implemented by changing the pre-processing steps and achieved better accuracy results(Xgboost- 97.2%, SGD- 90.02%, KNN-95.8%, Naive bayes- 86.1%) than what were mentioned in the paper(Xgboost- 89.3%, SGD- 76.7%, KNN-87%, Naive bayes- 78.3%).4 different algorithms were used while implementing the project which are XGBoost, K-nearest neighbors, stochastic gradient descent and Naive Bayes. Among the 4 the highest accuracy is oberved in XGBoost which is 97.2% and least accuracy is observed in Naive-Bayes is 86.1%
